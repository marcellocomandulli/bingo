# Wanna play Bingo but you lost numbers to draw? 

THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT when YOU DON'T HAVE those 90 numbers to draw (because someone lost them)...

You can enjoy play BINGO/TOMBOLA from your smartphone or computer, it's up to you!

You can see a big white board where every number drawn will be shown.

"ACTUAL NUMBER" shows the number just drawn. 

"LAST NUMBERS" shows the last 4 numbers drawn.

"NUMBERS DRAWN" shows how many numbers have already been drawn.

You can see 3 buttons: 
* "+" to draw a number, 
* "-" to go back, 
* "RESET" to start a new game.
